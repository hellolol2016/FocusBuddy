Hello! This is the OHWhiffer's submission for the 2021 HackVH hackathon. This is a pretty simple task manager that keeps track of how much time you spend on a certain task and 
also takes user input to print how distracted you were during a task. First "real" Java project for us. We hope you like it! 

ps: also has some bugs
